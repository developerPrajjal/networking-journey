Day 9 â€“ EtherChannel (PAgP)
ðŸ”¹ Theory Notes
What is EtherChannel?

EtherChannel is a link aggregation technology that allows multiple physical Ethernet links to be combined into a single logical link.

Provides increased bandwidth and fault tolerance.

If one physical link fails, traffic automatically shifts to remaining links.

Benefits:

Increased Bandwidth â€“ Multiple links act as one (e.g., 4 Ã— 100 Mbps = 400 Mbps).

Redundancy â€“ If one link fails, traffic keeps flowing.

STP Efficiency â€“ Spanning Tree Protocol treats the entire bundle as a single link, avoiding blocked redundant paths.

Load Balancing â€“ Distributes traffic across available links.

Protocols:

PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol) â†’ Cisco proprietary.

LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) â†’ IEEE standard (802.3ad).

On Mode â†’ Forces bundling without negotiation (manual).
