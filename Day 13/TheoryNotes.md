ðŸ“˜ Day 13 â€“ Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick with 2 VLANs)
ðŸ”¹ Theory Notes

Why VLANs?
VLANs logically segment a switch into multiple broadcast domains.

VLAN 10 â†’ e.g., Sales

VLAN 20 â†’ e.g., HR

The Problem: By default, devices in different VLANs cannot communicate.

Solution â€“ Router-on-a-Stick

Use one router interface connected to the switch.

Configure it as a trunk link.

Create subinterfaces (one per VLAN) on the router.

Each subinterface handles traffic for its VLAN using 802.1Q encapsulation.

Workflow:

Create VLANs on switch.

Assign switch ports to VLANs.

Configure trunk between switch & router.

On router â†’ create subinterfaces for each VLAN.

Assign IPs â†’ these act as default gateways for PCs.

Test ping across VLANs.
