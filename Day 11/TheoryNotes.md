ðŸ“˜ Theory Notes
ðŸ”¹ Why Consolidation Matters

Networking isnâ€™t just about moving to the next lab quickly. Itâ€™s about slowing down, revisiting, and connecting past concepts so that when advanced topics come, the foundation doesnâ€™t shake.

Todayâ€™s focus was on reinforcing and linking the concepts:

1. Static Routing

  Manually configured routes.

  Provides full control but doesnâ€™t scale well.

  Useful in small or controlled networks.

2. RIP (Routing Information Protocol)

  A dynamic routing protocol.

  Uses hop count as metric (max 15).

  Automates route learning and sharing between routers.

3. VLANs & Inter-VLAN Routing

  VLANs segment LANs into logical groups.

  Improves performance, security, and management.

  Inter-VLAN routing via a router or L3 switch allows communication across VLANs.

4.Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

  Prevents Layer 2 loops in switched networks.

  Elects a Root Bridge and blocks redundant links.

  Without STP, broadcast storms and loops can crash the network.

5. EtherChannel

  Bundles multiple physical links into one logical channel.

  Provides load balancing and redundancy.

  Uses negotiation protocols: PAgP (Cisco proprietary) or LACP (IEEE standard).
