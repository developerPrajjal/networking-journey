ðŸ“˜ Day 14 â€“ Multi-VLAN Router-on-a-Stick (4 VLANs)
ðŸ”¹ Theory Notes

Scaling Day 13â€™s setup to multiple VLANs.

Each VLAN still requires:

VLAN creation on switch.

Port assignment.

Router subinterface with dot1Q encapsulation + IP.

The concept remains same, but now router handles multiple VLANs.

Useful in medium networks where multiple departments exist:

VLAN 10 â†’ Sales

VLAN 20 â†’ HR

VLAN 30 â†’ IT

VLAN 40 â†’ Management
