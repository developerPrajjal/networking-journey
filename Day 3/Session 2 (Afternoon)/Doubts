ðŸ”¹ 1. Device Models

Cisco 2960 Switch â†’ a commonly used enterprise Layer 2 switch in Packet Tracer.

Cisco 1941 Router â†’ a standard enterprise router model in Packet Tracer.

ðŸ‘‰ In Packet Tracer, youâ€™ll see multiple switches & routers (like 2950, 3560, 2911, 2811).
We usually pick 2960 switch + 1941 router for CCNA labs because:

They are commonly covered in CCNA exam.

They have the right features (VLAN, trunking, router-on-a-stick, routing protocols).

They are simple, reliable, and used in most tutorials.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Interface Names

Each device has interfaces (ports) with specific names:

On Switch (2960):

Fa0/1 to Fa0/24 â†’ FastEthernet ports (24 in total).

Gi0/1, Gi0/2 â†’ Gigabit ports.

On Router (1941):

G0/0 and G0/1 â†’ Gigabit interfaces.

Some models have Fa0/0 or Fa0/1.

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

Fa0/1 means FastEthernet Port 1.

G0/0 means Gigabit Port 0/0.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Why we use specific ports in labs

For PCs â†’ Switch, we usually use Fa0/1, Fa0/2, Fa0/3 etc.

For Switch â†’ Router, we often use Fa0/24 (last port) so itâ€™s visually easy to remember.

On router, we usually use G0/0 as the connected interface.

ðŸ“Œ In short:

Numbers like 2960 / 1941 = device model in Packet Tracer.

Numbers like Fa0/1, G0/0 = port/interface IDs.
