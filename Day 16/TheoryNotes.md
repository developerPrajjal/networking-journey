ðŸ“˜ Theory Notes â€“ OSPF (Day X)
ðŸ”¹ What is OSPF?

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a link-state routing protocol.

Uses Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm.

Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) â†’ works inside an Autonomous System (AS).

Protocol type: Dynamic Routing.

ðŸ”¹ OSPF Features

Classless (supports VLSM & CIDR).

Metric: Cost (calculated based on interface bandwidth).

Fast convergence compared to RIP.

Supports areas for scalability:

Backbone Area (Area 0).

Non-backbone areas (must connect to Area 0).

Administrative Distance (AD): 110.

Supports authentication (clear text & MD5).

ðŸ”¹ OSPF Packet Types

Hello Packet (for neighbor discovery).

DBD â€“ Database Description.

LSR â€“ Link State Request.

LSU â€“ Link State Update.

LSAck â€“ Link State Acknowledgement.

ðŸ”¹ OSPF States (Neighbor Formation)

Down â†’ Init â†’ 2-Way â†’ ExStart â†’ Exchange â†’ Loading â†’ Full.

ðŸ”¹ Verification Commands

show ip route â†’ Check OSPF learned routes (marked with O).

show ip ospf neighbor â†’ OSPF adjacency status.

show ip protocols â†’ Networks advertised.

show ip ospf interface brief â†’ Interfaces running OSPF.
