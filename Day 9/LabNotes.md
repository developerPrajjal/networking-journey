üîπ Verification Commands

Check EtherChannel Summary

show etherchannel summary


Expected:

Po1(SU) ‚Üí Port-Channel1 is up and in use.

Member ports should show (P) ‚Üí bundled in channel.

Check Port-Channel Interface

show interfaces port-channel 1


Expected:

Port-channel1 is up, line protocol is up (connected).

Bandwidth is sum of all links (e.g., 400 Mb/s).

Check VLAN Membership

show vlan brief


Ensure PC ports (Fa0/5 on both switches) are in same VLAN (default VLAN 1).

Ping Test
On PC0:

ping 192.168.1.3


On PC1:

ping 192.168.1.2

üîπ Troubleshooting Steps (if ping fails)

Check if all ports are bundled: (P) flag must appear.

Verify VLAN membership of PC-facing ports.

Ensure both sides use same EtherChannel protocol (PAgP in this lab).

Check STP state: show spanning-tree.

Test with direct PC-to-PC same switch to isolate issue.

üîπ Key Takeaways

EtherChannel bundles multiple links to act as one logical connection.

Provides resilience, higher bandwidth, and STP efficiency.

In this lab, PAgP (desirable mode) was used to auto-negotiate EtherChannel.

Next step ‚Üí Troubleshoot inter-switch EtherChannel to achieve end-to-end PC communication.
