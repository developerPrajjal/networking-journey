ðŸ§ª Lab Recap & Key Learnings

Since today was consolidation, the labs revisited were:

1. Static Routing Lab

  Verified connectivity between two networks using manually configured static routes.

  Confirmed that PCs across routers could ping successfully after routes were added.

2. RIP Lab

  Replaced static routes with RIP configuration.

  Observed automatic route exchange between routers.

  Verified end-to-end connectivity with successful pings.

3. VLAN & Inter-VLAN Lab

  Configured VLANs and tested communication within VLANs.
  
  Added Inter-VLAN routing to allow different VLANs to communicate.

  Verified via ping tests.

4. STP Lab

  Connected redundant links between switches.

  Observed STP electing a root bridge and blocking redundant ports.

  Ensured no broadcast storm or loop occurred.

5. EtherChannel Lab (In-progress)

Began configuration with multiple switch links.

Verified Port-Channel creation and logical bundling.

Troubleshooting pending for full PC-to-PC connectivity (will continue in Day 12).
