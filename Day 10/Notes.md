Day 10 â€“ Thorough Revision & Consolidation
ðŸ”¹ Purpose of Todayâ€™s Session

Instead of working on new labs, today was fully dedicated to a comprehensive revision of all the concepts practiced so far. The goal was to reinforce the fundamentals and ensure clarity before moving into more advanced topics like EtherChannel troubleshooting and OSPF.

ðŸ”¹ Topics Revised
1. Static Routing

Configuring static routes on routers using ip route command.

Understanding next-hop vs exit-interface.

Verified connectivity across multiple networks.

2. VLANs & Inter-VLAN Routing

Concept of VLANs for logical segmentation of LANs.

Assigning ports to VLANs using switchport access vlan.

Configured Router-on-a-Stick to allow communication between VLANs.

3. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

STP prevents switching loops in redundant networks.

Learned about root bridge election, port roles (Root, Designated, Blocked).

Verified STP states with show spanning-tree.

4. EtherChannel (Introduction)

Concept of bundling multiple physical links into one logical link.

Benefits: increased bandwidth, redundancy, STP efficiency.

Configured EtherChannel using PAgP (desirable mode).

Verified with show etherchannel summary and show interfaces port-channel.

Troubleshooting pending: verifying end-to-end PC communication.

ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways

Revision is just as important as new learning â€” it strengthens the foundation.

Step-by-step consistency builds confidence for upcoming advanced topics.

Networking requires both hands-on labs and conceptual clarity.
